    <p><font size="12">My first coding Expirence:</font></p>
    <p><font size="5">Hello friends, this is my true story,when i was in 6th std. i was newly introduced to html markup language then, <br>
    i got my new hobby 'coding' after i learn html in my school  i research a lot about html learning on youtube i learnt extra then school learning
.After a lot time approx. 1 to 2 yrs I thought that i should try to make projects on my own.Sometime i got fail and sometime success but i never stepped back when there was a failure. After making small projects i got introduced to some languages that is most used languages with html and they are CSS and JAVASCRIPT. JavaScript is mainly for backend but html and css are for frontend. If you ask me what languages are easier among them, i will tell both html and css are easy but JavaScript is hard to learn and to operate also. Now i got that i have to learn everything. In today's life i m very good at html and css but not at JavaScript. <br> </font></p>
        <p><font size="7">Thanks for reading.</font></p>
